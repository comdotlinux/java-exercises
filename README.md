Java Exercises to understand java basics

This is a simple maven project which runs unit tests as part of the build which is nothing special but helps keep the intent of the java code clear.
It helps the reader get an understanding of how it works and can optionally run the test for himself and check the values in debug to understand what is going on.

I hope to keep adding to this some esoteric examples and questions often asked in interviews to test the depth of knowledge of candidates.

However anything that I like and can be tested could go here but should be Java related :)

List of examples (Could be incomplete!)

* enums
	* Fast fromString method
	* Sorting
* equals and hashCode
* File reader
* Merging two lists -- specifically 1 from first list and then 1 from second list including different sized lists
